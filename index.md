## Predict the multi-directional trajectory of pedestrians

A Cognitive approach to predict the multi-directional trajectory of pedestrians is developed using Deep Learning algorithms. Pedestrian detection is one of the important areas in computer vision. This work is about detecting the multidirectional pedestrianâ€™s left, right, and front movements. In this work, a modified Faster Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (MFR-CNN), a cognitive approach is proposed for detecting the direction of movement of pedestrians and it can be deployed in real-time.
